# formula1charts
A different way to compare formula 1 statistics.

You can access here: [F1 Charts](https://sleepy-happy-kepler.cidemo.co/)

In this project I used Python scripts with BeautifulSoup to scrap over F1 pages, and also an specific F1 API [ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) that was very useful, to gather several info about races wins, podiums and others numbers. Then I created this Django app to display pages with an variety of cool interactive charts (from NIVO lib).
