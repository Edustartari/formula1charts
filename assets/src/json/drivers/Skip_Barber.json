While building a career in SCCA and CanAm racing, in 1971 Barber purchased a March 711, with the intention of bringing it back to North America for Formula 5000 racing. Instead, he wound up entering the car in six Grands Prix in 1971 and 1972, with a best finish of 16th at the 1972 United States Grand Prix.In 1975, Barber saw a need and filled it. With two loaned Formula Fords and four students, he founded what became the Skip Barber Racing School, one of the most successful driving schools in the world. Alumni of the school have won every major race and championship in the US, save Formula One.Today Barber lives in the hills of northwestern Connecticut, where he and his wife are the owner-operators of Lime Rock Park, one of the classic race tracks of the United States."}
