He won the 2007 World Drivers' Championship in his first year with Ferrari after replacing the then-retired Michael Schumacher, and went on to win 21 Grands Prix, more than any other Finnish driver in Formula 1 history.  After a two-year stint at Alfa Romeo (formerly Sauber), Rikknen retired at the end of the 2021 season.  At the time of his retirement, he held the distinction as the most experienced driver in F1 history with 349 Grand Prix starts.  However, he lost this distinction to Fernando Alonso the following year."}
