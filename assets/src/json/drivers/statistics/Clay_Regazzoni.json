Regazzoni is the most successful Swiss driver to date with 5 wins to his name. In 1980, Regazzoni was forced to retire from the sport in 1980 due to injuries sustained at the 1980 United States Grand Prix West which saw him paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. After Formula One he became a notable F1 commentator with Swiss and Italian television. Regazzoni was killed on 15 December 2006 when the road car he was driving collided with the back of a lorry at approximately 100km/h whilst driving near the city of Parma in Italy.
