He was born in 1903 in the German Empire, and was a moderately successful driver before the war, but never entered a Grand Prix. After the war, his home town became part of East Germany, and under that flag he entered the German Grand Prix twice, finishing both times. Soon after the 1953 race, he retired from racing due to age. He later defected to the west, and died in West Germany in 1973.", "titles_percentage": 0.0, "poles_percentage": 0.0, "wins_percentage": 0.0, "podiums_percentage": 0.0}
