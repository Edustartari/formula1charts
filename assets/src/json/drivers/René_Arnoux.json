    "introduction": "\"Rene had a special place he would visit sometimes, when boost was sky-high and one-lap-qualifiers fitted. Then he would stare into the abyss, and dance with fate. Eighteen times this gave him a pole lap that was scary to behold. The way he bullied his Ferrari from the back up to second at Dallas '84 - a 180mph bronco flailing between the concrete walls - was awesome. And only Arnoux could conceivably have fought that legendary fight with Villeneuve at Dijon.\" - Mark Hughes"
