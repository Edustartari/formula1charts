He entered his own Cooper T82 in one Formula One race, the 1967 Canadian Grand Prix.  After a promising practice performance, he suffered electrical problems during qualifying and only set one very slow lap time.  The stewards denied him a place on the grid on the grounds that he was \"too slow\", even though he had been competitive in practice runs."}
